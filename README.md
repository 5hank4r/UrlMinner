# URL MINNER
Scan Android APK files for endpoints and extract them into a text file for further analysis.


## Usage


```
./URL.sh <apk-file>


Replace <apk-file> with the path to the APK file you want to scan.

The script will decompile the APK file, extract the HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, and save them to a file named endpoints.txt in the same directory as the APK file.
